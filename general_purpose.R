#####NOTE###########
#Entity names in the original Acfrs database are not obvious, i.e., 
# They do not always contain a certain word to indicate its government type (i.e., city, town, county, etc). 

# *ACFRs data has government_id (which is called census_id in the ACFRs portal). 
# This is government unit identifier, and is not geo_id that are often used in many census datasets.
# 
# Two points above constitute challenges when we need to:
# 1) adding population field in acfrs data, and 
# 2) sort out what type of entities are collected.
# 
# * Two main ways to solve the problems: 
# - Use a "middle file" to link geo_id and government_ID
# - Joining by names and states 

##### ACFRs General Purpose 

# step 1: get all general purpose entities in acfrs, most contains governmentID

  rename(government_id = census_id) %>%  # census_id in Acfrs database is actually government_id
       
  # some government_id in ACFRs has 13 characters-> need to add 0
  mutate(government_id = ifelse(str_length(government_id) < 14, paste0("0", government_id), government_id)) %>% 
  
# step 2: join with the middle file to get geo_id into acfrs data
  left_join(governmentID_geoID, by = c("state.abb", "government_id")) %>% 
  
  # cleaning to match with names in census
  mutate(name = str_to_lower(name),
         name = str_remove_all(name, "(\\.)|(\\')"),
         # In LA, ACFRs of some parish titled "parish police jury" -> Geoff: these are counties ACFRs
         name = str_remove_all(name, "police jury"), 
         name = str_remove_all(name, " fiscal court"),
         name = str_trim(name)) %>%
